Version: 0.1.0

## Summary
This project's purpose is to, on the user's selected day/time, login to a schedule online. It will save a screenshot, and then notify the user when their schedule is ready to view, before returning to hibernation.  
Enough of having to remember to login and jump through hoops just to get the schedule in your hands, Schedual Portal Two is here to help you spend your time on more important things like Minecraft or Stardew Valley.  

*Currently runs off the user's computer, but in the future it may be migrated to a server to remove the dependancy of the computer being on.*

## Development

### Planned Features:
*These are the core features that are to be implement in order for me to consider this project as it's Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*

- [x] Capture Schedule (*implemented: Version 0.1.0*)
- [ ] Create a System Notification
- [ ] Allow User Setup & Improved Interaction
- [ ] Sleep, Wake, and Run on Start Up

### Possible Features:  
*These are considered to be beyond the scope of the project, and are "Nice-to-Have's". So, I wont promiss that I will or even have the current know how to make them happen. 

- [ ] Server Hosted - Will remove limitations of being in one geological location and constantly monitors current date as to not miss a schedule call.
